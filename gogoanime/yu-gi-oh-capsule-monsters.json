    "description": "Capsule Monsters involves Yugi, Joey (Jonouchi), T\u00e9a (Anzu), Tristan (Honda), and Yugi\u2019s grandfather Solomon (Sugoroku) being pulled into a world where Duel Monsters are real. They find monster capsules that they can use to summon monsters. It is similar to the Virtual RPG arc in many respects, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with the early Capsule Monster Chess game.",
