Evangelion 1.0, presented at Sitges'08, re-updated the series' first six episodes and Evangelion 2.0 continues the task with the following fourteen. Mari, a new pilot, joins the NERV crew to continue defending Tokyo-3 from the Angels' attacks as the \"Third impact\" approaches, a catastrophe that, if it occurred, would permanently change humanity's destiny.",
