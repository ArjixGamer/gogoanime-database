Together with her upperclassman\u00a0Yukari, a girl who seems perfect but is actually quite airheaded, as local idols, they get interviewed (by the town's shopping centre), go on television (low-budget cable), and do concerts (on the roof of the department store). The girls' salaries come from the town's taxes.",
