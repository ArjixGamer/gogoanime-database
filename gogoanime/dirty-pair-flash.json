Fiery, she can be very single-minded and when she sets herself to a task, she will let nothing get in her way. Prone to violence at the drop of a hat, her solution to any problem is to blow it up. She is oil to Yuri's water and firmly convinced that the only partner she needs is her trusty blaster.",
