    "description": "The\u00a0Umbrella Incident\u00a0that took place in Raccoon City was ended with the eradication of the deadly virus by a missile attack ordered by the government. As its operations were suspended on a global scale, Umbrella Corporation stock plummeted. This serious blow to the business giant resulted in its complete dissolution. 7 years later, at an airport somewhere in the United States. An ordinary autumn afternoon. One zombie is unleashed into this peaceful scene to attack everyone. In the airport starting to fill up with the undead, the horrific disaster is about to be repeat itself...The story is set to take place 7 years after the events depicted in the Biohazard and Biohazard 2 games (Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2 on the western market) featuring Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield (both of who were the protagonists in Biohazard 2).",
