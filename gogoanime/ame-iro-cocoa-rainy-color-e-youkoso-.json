    "description": "Life at the Rainy Color caf\u00e9 can never be described as boring. The arrival of the Koga brothers from England \u2013 Noel, always brimming with curiosity, and Nicola, somewhat shy and conservative \u2013 ensures that their sibling, caf\u00e9 manager Shion, is kept on his toes. There\u2019s also another newcomer, cameraman/photographer Jun Arisawa, who holds a mysterious connection to caf\u00e9 owner Koji Amami. Last but not least, there\u2019s a special photograph that incites all kinds of heartfelt and comedic reactions from the Rainy Color crew!",
