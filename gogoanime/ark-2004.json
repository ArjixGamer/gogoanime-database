The only way to escape the dying world is by activating the Ark, an ancient giant robot capable of supporting a human city as well as traveling through space. James Woods plays Jallak, the military leader of the victorious civilization, the Storrians, who is trying to get the Ark to work in order to save his people. Unbeknownst to him, his adopted daughter Amarinth is the direct descendant of the priestess who originally built the Ark, Amiel. The civilization that lost the war, the Ceveans, have since been enslaved. A leader of their resistance movement is a young resistance fighter named Rogan. After discovering the lineage the young woman holds, both civilizations scramble to use Amarinth's power to activate the Ark and leave the other civilization behind to die. However, Amarinth, who has ties to both civilizations, wishes to try and find a way to use her power to save everyone. She is opposed by the lifeforce-stealing wraith Baramanda, the Empress's manipulative right-hand man, who wishes to steal the power of the Ark for his own selfish purposes.\u00a0less",
