Two runaway girls, Izumi Sawatari and her younger sister Mitsuki, stumped into Nakabayashi\u2019s mansion and got hired by Yoshitaka immediately, for Yoshitaka is not only a rich boy but also a pervert with uniform fetishes, who wants to be addressed as goshujin-sama (master). Having nowhere else to settle down along with Mitsuki\u2019s pet alligator Pochi, Izumi accepted the job reluctantly.",
