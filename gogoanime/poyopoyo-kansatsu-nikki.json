It was a fated encounter, so Moe adopts the stray. Many small daily-life adventures await the Satou family: Moe, her brother\u00a0Hide\u00a0(a high school student), father\u00a0Shigeru\u00a0(a farmer) and the mysterious, at times fast, high-jumping, gentle and very cute Poyo, who even likes to take baths.",
