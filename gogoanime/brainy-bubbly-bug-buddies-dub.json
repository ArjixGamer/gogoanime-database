    "description": "Wouldn't it be great fun for an animated series to focus on the lively workings of the insect world, just as children started exploring the wonders of nature for themselves? Brainy Bubbly Bug Buddies, Fantawild's new 104-episode series, spins charming tales from the woods to the wetlands, spotlighting a bustling colony of creepy-crawlies-and the cheerfully troublesome frog they count as neighbor and friend. Amid the insect-adventures, audiences will get a bug's-eye view of the habits and habitats of actual insects of many kinds, and will learn how these creatures thrive in their environments. Imagine children everywhere sitting down to be entertained, and getting up with a new understanding of the world around them! In Brainy Bubbly Bug Buddies, characters thrive in a lush wetland paradise. Among its inhabitants are Bartle Bee, the fencing-master bumblebee; Flutterby, the elegant butterfly; Strobe and Sparkle, the heart-of-gold firefly brothers; and McBroom, the hardest-working beetle in the land. The Marsh is always buzzing with activity, and little viewers will be captivated by the lively blend of action and discovery to be found in its colorful environs. Our exoskeletal heroes bring their collective skills and ingenuity to bear on life's challenges in The Marsh, and in the end, they are rewarded for their efforts. Young learners are thus reminded that problem-solving is often best accomplished as a joint effort-and, coincidentally, that we live in a vast world worthy of exploration at even the most minute level of existence. Regular visits to The Marsh will delight and intrigue, all while nurturing children's budding quest for knowledge-and imbuing them with a healthy respect for life in the natural realm.",
