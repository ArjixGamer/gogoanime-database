    "description": "Watanuki Kimihiro can see spirits and other assorted supernatural creatures, which is quite a bothersome ability he strongly dislikes. On the way home one day, while plagued by some spirits, he is inexplicably compelled to enter a strange house. There, he encounters Yuuko, a mysterious woman who claims to be able to rid him of the ability to see and attract the troublesome creatures \u2013 for a price. She demands that he work at her \u201cstore\u201d that grants wishes to people, and thus begins Watanuki's adventures through weird and wonderful events.",
