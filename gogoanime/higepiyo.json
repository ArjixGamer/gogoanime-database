    "description": "The story of Higepiyo (literally \u201cMustache-Peep\u201d) revolves around Hiyoko, a \u201csurreal\u201d bird that happens to have a mustache. Hiyoko can talk with \u201cPiroshi\u201d \u2014 Hiroshi, the human boy who bought her at a night fair \u2014 and the two are tight friends. In fact, Hiyoko teaches Hiroshi how to win brawls in elementary school, and she sometimes fights a bullying girl on Hiroshi\u2019s behalf. (Hiyoko is actually an experimental test subject that escaped from a laboratory.)",
