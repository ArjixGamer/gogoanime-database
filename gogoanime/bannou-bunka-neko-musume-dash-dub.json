Having lost her memory, Nuku-Nuku assumed the identity of a beautiful girl named Atsuko Higuchi.

However, after her arrival in town, a series of mysterious incidents started to happen in Maneki City - Experimental machines running haywire, roaring fighter aircraft flying low, mass destruction in the city. In every case, a mysterious girl was spotted at the scene of the incident.",
