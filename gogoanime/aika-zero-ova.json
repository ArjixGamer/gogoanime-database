    "description": "The new OVA, titled \u201cAIka Zero,\u201d will take place 3 years after Aika R-16 & 7 years before the original Agent Aika classic. That puts our heroine at 19 years old, & the character designs reflect as much. 19-year-old Aika seems like a cross-over between the cute & young 16-year-old Aika from R-16, & the sexy mature 26-year-old Aika from the original.",
