Later, the girls visit Jinbouchou, where they visit the buildings of various publishers whilst searching for\u00a0Kodansha's office. Afterwards,\u00a0Kigu\u00a0ends up concentrating so much that she ends up being afflicted with focus lines whilst\u00a0Marii\u00a0also becomes afflicted with a romantic and fluffy backdrop.",
