With a profit/loss margin in mind, the company decides to create a new marketing department sub-unit, designed to use the Dai-Guard robot in the defense of Japan. The work relationship between Akaji, Ibuki and Aoyama allow them to be the best of friends, and a most troublesome combat team.Office workers saving the world!!",
