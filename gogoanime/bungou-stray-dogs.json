    "description": "The \"battle action\" story Bungou Stray Dogs centers around a league of literary figures with supernatural powers. For example, in real life, Akutagawa Ryuunosuke wrote acclaimed stories that inspired Kurosawa Akira's Rashoumon film and the Aoi Bungaku Series anime's Jigoku Hen (Hell Screen) arc. In Bungou Stray Dogs, he has the power to transform and manipulate his cloak into a monster-like entity. Together, these writers solve mysteries as part of the \"Armed Detective Agency.\"",
